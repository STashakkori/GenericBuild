# GenericBuild
Using Mike Crawford's generic makefile as a build system for Salvum

Original is here:
https://github.com/mbcrawfo/GenericMakefile

Adding a few lines to the Makefile and driving it with Rust, we succeeeded
in a nice way to throw libraries in with the source code and also to set the
compiler and quickly build
